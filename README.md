# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning


# Requirements

* Python 3.5 +
* Keras (latest version)
* Numpy (+ mkl for Windows)

# Install requirements form the 'requirements.txt' file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to use

* Open a command prompt in the directory 'handwitten_digit_recog_cli' and type

```
python script.py 'name_of_image.jpg'
```

* Some sample images are present in 'test_images' directory.  

**NOTE: Images must be of '.jpg' format.**


## Test accuracy, loss and error using Deep Neural Network:

* Test Loss: 0.03%
* Test Accuracy: 99.88%
* Test Error: 0.78%



**All code written in Python 3.5.**
